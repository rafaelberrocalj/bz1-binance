# bz1-binance

Simple project for Binance Orders Convert History.

## Why?

Needed to list all my Pair Orders Convert History, and the Binance UX/UI was not so good for this.

## "User Secrets"

```
{
  "API_KEY": "your binance api key",
  "API_SECRET": "your binance api secret",
  "START_DATE": "2021/01/01"
}
```
